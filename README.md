### Overview of the Code
#### Libraries and Data Loading:

Libraries such as ape, dendextend, tidyverse, ggtree, gridExtra, ggtreeExtra, and ggstar are loaded.
The dataset lumB_lumA.csv is read into a dataframe df.
#### Data Preprocessing:

Extracts unique genes from the MergedGenes column in the dataframe.
Creates a binary matrix indicating the presence of each gene for each description (term).
#### Cluster Analysis:

Computes a Jaccard similarity matrix.
Performs hierarchical clustering using the Ward.D2 method.
Converts the hierarchical clustering object into a dendrogram and then into a phylogenetic tree (Newick format).
#### Plotting with ggtree:

Creates a circular dendrogram plot with ggtree.
Enhances the plot with geom_fruit to add bar plots and star shapes to the tips of the dendrogram.
#### Saving the Plot:

Saves the plot as an SVG file with specific dimensions and DPI.
